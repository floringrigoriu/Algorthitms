Project :
Implement a bit counter for int32, int64, BigInt and Int256 via following methods
- bit shifting [done]
- bit counting by zero-ing 1s [done]
- masking [done]
- modulo odd values
- MMX instruction


test :
- unit test -> validate correctness [pending]

- performance test -> handle 1M random generated numbers and generate a time execution report
